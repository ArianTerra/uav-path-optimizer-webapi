# UAV Path Optimization

## Overview

The UAV Path Optimization project is an API-based solution that focuses on solving optimization problems related to UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) path planning. The primary goal of the project is to provide efficient routing solutions for multiple UAVs, addressing both the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

## Features

- [x] API endpoint for solving VRP and TSP problems
- [ ] API endpoint for creating schedules for UAVs
- [x] User authorization and authentication endpoints
